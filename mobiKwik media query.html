                        <h4>About MobiKwik</h4>
                        <p>We are a Fintech company – one of the largest mobile wallets and one of the largest Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) players in India. Digitally paying users have been rapidly growing in India in the last decade, but the credit card penetration in the country is still only 3.5%. We are focused on addressing the unmet credit needs of the fast growing digitally paying users by combining the convenience of everyday mobile payments with the benefits of BNPL.
                            <p>Founded in 2009 by Bipin Preet Singh and Upasana Taku, we commenced operations as a mobile wallet to make digital payments convenient for our users. Our use cases have since expanded to include bill payments, ecommerce shopping, food delivery, petrol pumps, large retail chains, pharmacies, kirana stores, etc. Our platform also enables peer-to-peer payments via unified payment interface (“UPI”), MobiKwik Wallet as well as MobiKwik Wallet to bank payments.

                            <p>In order to further enhance our value proposition to our online merchants, we introduced our payment gateway subsidiary Zaakpay in 2012. Zaakpay enables online websites and mobile apps to collect payments from their users using multiple payment options, including debit cards, credit cards, mobile wallets, UPI and net banking. In May 2019, we launched MobiKwik Zip, our flagship BNPL product, with a focus on the Indian middle-class population to enable them to make payments for daily life use cases. MobiKwik Zip is focused on providing this unserved Indian population their first experience of credit.</p>
